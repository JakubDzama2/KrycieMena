    <string name="about_app">This app is the final project of one subject at the university where I study.
So, yes, I am a student and I like board games such as Krycie Mená (which were not uploaded on Google Play yet), so I decided to program this game.
        It\'s a simple app, but I believe you\'ll like it. Enjoy the game!\n\nHere is the link with the original rules for this game in a pdf file:</string>
